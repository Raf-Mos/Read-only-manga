# Hostinger Deployment Fix - README

## Problem Analysis
Your manga reader app was designed for Vercel deployment but you're hosting it on Hostinger. The main issues were:

1. **Serverless Functions**: Vercel supports serverless functions (`/api/` directory), but Hostinger is traditional hosting that doesn't support this.
2. **CORS Issues**: Direct API calls to MangaDx from browser get blocked by CORS policy.
3. **Environment Detection**: The app couldn't properly detect the hosting platform.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced API Service Configuration
- **File**: `src/services/mangadx-enhanced.ts` (new enhanced version)
- **Changes**:
  - Added platform detection (Vercel vs Hostinger vs Development)
  - Implemented CORS proxy fallback mechanism
  - Enhanced error handling with retry logic
  - Added multiple CORS proxy services as fallbacks

### 2. Environment Variables Configuration
- **File**: `.env.production`
- **Purpose**: Configure the app for different hosting platforms
- **Variables**:
  - `REACT_APP_HOSTING_PLATFORM=hostinger`
  - `REACT_APP_HOSTINGER=true`
  - `REACT_APP_VERCEL=false`

### 3. Hostinger-Specific Configuration
- **File**: `public/.htaccess`
- **Purpose**: Configure Apache server on Hostinger for:
  - SPA (Single Page Application) routing
  - Gzip compression
  - Caching for static assets
  - Security headers
  - CORS headers

### 4. Build Scripts Enhancement
- **File**: `package.json`
- **Changes**: Added platform-specific build scripts:
  - `npm run build:hostinger` - Build for Hostinger
  - `npm run build:vercel` - Build for Vercel

### 5. Netlify-style Redirects (Optional)
- **File**: `public/_redirects`
- **Purpose**: Backup routing configuration (if Hostinger supports it)

## How to Deploy to Hostinger

### Step 1: Build for Hostinger
```bash
npm run build:hostinger
```

### Step 2: Upload to Hostinger
1. Copy all contents from the `build/` folder
2. Upload to your Hostinger domain's `public_html` folder
3. Make sure the `.htaccess` file is uploaded and visible

### Step 3: Test the Deployment
1. Visit your Hostinger domain
2. Check browser console for any API errors
3. Test manga loading functionality

## Fallback Mechanisms

The enhanced service includes multiple fallback strategies:

1. **Platform Detection**: Automatically detects if running on Vercel or traditional hosting
2. **CORS Proxy Fallback**: If direct API calls fail, it tries CORS proxy services:
   - `https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=`
   - `https://thingproxy.freeboard.io/fetch/`
3. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for network issues

## Alternative Solutions

If the CORS proxy approach doesn't work reliably:

### Option 1: Use Your Own Backend
Create a simple backend server (Node.js, PHP, Python) that proxies requests to MangaDx API.

### Option 2: Cloudflare Workers
Use Cloudflare Workers to create a CORS proxy (if your domain uses Cloudflare).

### Option 3: Switch to Vercel
Vercel provides serverless functions that handle CORS issues automatically.

## Monitoring & Debugging

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for CORS or network errors
2. **Network Tab**: Monitor which requests fail and succeed
3. **API Logs**: The service logs platform detection and fallback attempts

## Files Modified/Created

✅ **Enhanced Services**:
- `src/services/mangadx-enhanced.ts` - New enhanced API service
- `src/config/api.ts` - Configuration helper

✅ **Build Configuration**:
- `package.json` - Added Hostinger build script
- `.env.production` - Environment variables

✅ **Hostinger Configuration**:
- `public/.htaccess` - Apache configuration
- `public/_redirects` - Netlify-style redirects (backup)

✅ **Original Files** (kept for reference):
- `api/mangadx/[...path].js` - Vercel serverless function
- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Test the deployment** on Hostinger
2. **Monitor API performance** and fallback usage
3. **Consider implementing your own backend** if CORS proxies are unreliable
4. **Update imports** to use the enhanced service if needed

The enhanced solution should resolve the API connectivity issues on Hostinger while maintaining compatibility with other hosting platforms.
